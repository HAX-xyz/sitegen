This directory contains 'static'-files, as in, the actual template to use for generation.
The template is a single .html, 'static.html'.

Also of note is that all non-html-files will be copied to out/static/ to allow for css and other assets.

static.html will be used as the skeleton for generation; excepting "<!content>" which will be replaced with the actual content, fetched from the page being processed.

To better explain this, a simple static.html looks like:

<!content>

which means that the entire page will consist of only the content, as defined in pages/*.htm.
