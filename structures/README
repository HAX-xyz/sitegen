A .strct-file consists of lines corresponding to directories and files.

A directory is denoted by a opening parenthesis as a suffix, i.e. 'this_is_a_directory('
Directories can be nested.
A file is just a simple line, for instance 'index.html'
.strct-files also support one case of string substitution; $FILE will be replaced by the filename (without suffix).
