A .strct-file consists of lines corresponding to directories and files.

A directory is denoted by a opening parenthesis as a suffix, i.e. 'this_is_a_directory('
Directories can be nested.
A file is just a simple line, for instance 'index.html'
To "close" a directory, as in, move the working directory up one level, put a single closing parenthesis on a line.
.strct-files also support one case of string substitution; $FILE will be replaced by the filename (without suffix).

For a full, working, example, look at template.strct or default.strct in this directory.
