Currently, gen.sh looks for *.htm in this directory, then restructures these files into what is described in the chosen .strct.

Example:
Upon running './gen.sh default' on a freshly cloned version of this repo, the following files and directories will be created:
out/
    people/
        template/
            index.html
            
Where the resulting 'index.html' will be a copy of 'template.htm'.
